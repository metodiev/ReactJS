npx - npm package runner

4. Component Types:

Stateless Fuctional Component -> return html
Stateful Class Component -> Class extending Component Class| Render Method returning HTML

App.js is a class component

Functional Components

JavaScript Function -> HTML(JSX)

Class Components -> es6 class -> HTML JSX

Functional Component vs Class component

Use func componets as much as possible
Absence of this keyword
Sollution without using state


Class Components

Much feature rich
Maintaint ther own private data -state
Complex UI logic
Prodive lifecycle hooks


React 16.7.0 - alpha

Cool new feature which kind of contradicts what we've learn about functional versus state 
components
2019 -> Hooks let you use state without using a class

Hooks -> 
No Braking changes
Completley opt in & backwards-compatible
Component types -> Functional component, Class component
Using state lifecycle methods and this binding.


JSX -> 
Javascript XML - Extension to the JavaScript language syntax
Write XML-like code for elements and components
JSX tags have a tag name, attribues and childer


JSX differences between HTML

Class -> className
for -> htmlFor
onclick -> onClick
tabindex -> tabIndex
